## Acknowledgements

Traces was inspired by the [brilliant data walking apps](https://datawalking.com/apps.html) from [Data Walking](https://datawalking.com/), a research project developed by [David Hunter](http://davidhunterdesign.com/). These tools – and the research underlying them – sparked our imagination about how mobile phones can support data walks. Traces uses ideas from the interface of the individual tools and aims to bring them together into one app and expand on the possible ways to collect data.

Traces is an outcome of [Radical Data](https://radicaldata.org)'s project Comapping, which focuses on researching and building tools for community mapping. The initial research of Comapping as well as the initial development of Traces was funded through [The Humanity in Action Democracy Fellowship](https://humanityinaction.org/democracyfellowship/).
